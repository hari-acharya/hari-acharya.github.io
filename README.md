# Welcome!
 This is my first project and in this project I'm going to build my personal portfolio website using the HTML,CSS and JavaScript technology.

This is the first attempt in the official projects (Kinda :P ) so, Please don't judge me by the way I code and everything else. Thanks for being with the project.

Things that I will be doing for the first week:

1. Create HTML Pages of all the documents.

# JUST FOUND OUT THAT STUDY/ NOTES ARE VERY IMPORTANT ASAP!
